In this directory, you can include additional data, such are RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq results, meta-data etc.
Maximum functionality is achieved if the data is organized in subdirectories per sample, group, cell-type and other variables that are recorded in the sample sheet.

See example directory structure below:
.
|-- Bcells
|   |-- ATAC.bed
|   `-- H3K27ac.bed
`-- Tcells
    |-- ATAC.bed
    `-- H3K27ac.bed
